# MoodMe  
## A daily journal to track how you feel

Journaling is *hard*.  Sure it sounds simple: just write about how you feel.  
But papers get scattered, you type things down and forget about them, and looking back   
through past entries becomes more exhausting than counting individual grains of sand.  

"Talked about the project with Johnson" - what does that even mean?  
Was it exciting or a snooze-fest?  You'll never be able to tell; you might as well give up.  
This journaling idea was stupid in the first place.  It's a *disaster*.

That's where MoodMe comes in.

### Why was the creator interested in making MoodMe?

As someone who has tried (and failed) many times to start journaling, William Gao created  
MoodMe to address the issues he came across.  Like many university students,  
William struggled to find the time to journal - much less make an organized and visually  
pleasing one.  MoodMe is his answer to that problem.
